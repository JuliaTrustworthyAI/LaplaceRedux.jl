# Laplace approximation for effortless Bayesian deep learning

### Key points

**Mentors**: Cameron Pfiffer

**Project difficulty**: Easy

**Project length**: 175 hrs

**Description**: Laplace Approximation (LA) is a computationally cheap way to estimate Gaussian posteriors first proposed in the 18th century. In their [NeurIPS 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14806.pdf) @daxberger2021laplace demonstrate empirically that LA can be readily applied to deep neural networks and provide an open source [implementation](https://aleximmer.github.io/Laplace/) in PyTorch. The goal of this project is to integrate LA in Turing.jl building on [this](https://www.paltmeyer.com/LaplaceRedux.jl/dev/) bare bones Julia implementation.
