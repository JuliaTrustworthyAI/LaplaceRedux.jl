# LaplaceRedux

Documentation for [LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl).

`LaplaceRedux.jl` is a library written in pure Julia that can be used for effortless Bayesian Deep Learning trough Laplace Approximation (LA). In the development of this package I have drawn inspiration from this Python [library](https://aleximmer.github.io/Laplace/index.html#setup) and its companion [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14806) (Daxberger et al. 2021).

## üö© Installation

The stable version of this package can be installed as follows:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LaplaceRedux.jl")
```

The development version can be installed like so:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl")
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Basic Usage

`LaplaceRedux.jl` can be used for any neural network trained in [`Flux.jl`](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/dev/). Below we show basic usage examples involving two simple models for a regression and a classification task, respectively.

### Regression

A complete worked example for a regression model can be found in the [docs](https://www.paltmeyer.com/LaplaceRedux.jl/dev/tutorials/regression/). Here we jump straight to Laplace Approximation and take the pre-trained model `nn` as given. Then LA can be implemented as follows, where we specify the model `likelihood`. The plot show the fitted values overlayed with a 95% confidence interval. As expected, predictive uncertainty quickly increases in areas that are not populated by any training data.

``` julia
la = Laplace(nn; likelihood=:regression)
fit!(la, data)
optimize_prior!(la)
plot(la, X, y; zoom=-5, size=(400,400))
```

### Binary Classification

Once again we jump straight to LA and refer to the [docs](https://www.paltmeyer.com/LaplaceRedux.jl/dev/tutorials/mlp/) for a complete worked example involving binary classification. In this case we need to specify `likelihood=:classification`. The plot below shows the resulting posterior predictive distributions as contours in the two-dimensional feature space: note how the **Plugin** Approximation on the left compares to the Laplace Approximation on the right.

``` julia
la = Laplace(nn; likelihood=:classification)
fit!(la, data)
la_untuned = deepcopy(la)   # saving for plotting
optimize_prior!(la; verbose=true, n_steps=500)

# Plot the posterior predictive distribution:
zoom=0
p_plugin = plot(la, X, ys; title="Plugin", link_approx=:plugin, clim=(0,1))
p_untuned = plot(la_untuned, X, ys; title="LA - raw (Œª=$(unique(diag(la_untuned.P‚ÇÄ))[1]))", clim=(0,1), zoom=zoom)
p_laplace = plot(la, X, ys; title="LA - tuned (Œª=$(round(unique(diag(la.P‚ÇÄ))[1],digits=2)))", clim=(0,1), zoom=zoom)
plot(p_plugin, p_untuned, p_laplace, layout=(1,3), size=(1700,400))
```
